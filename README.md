## Hi there 👋
I'm [Shreejal Rai](https://linkedin.com/in/shreejal-r-98753a25a), a Business Information Systems graduate based in Austraila. I like to unravel data and transform it into actionable insights.

If data pops into my life, chances are I’ll analyze it all. My primary tool is Power BI for data visualization, and I’m currently learning R to expand my analytical capabilities.

I have skills in SQL for database management, and Python Programming for web designing and data analysis. In addition, I am proficient with the Microsoft Office Suite (especially Excel) for data manipulation and reporting.

One of my favorite projects involved a comprehensive analysis of renewable energy [in Norway](https://github.com/ShreejalRai/Change-in-renewable-energy.git).

I have a growing portfolio that showcase my abilities and insights which you can check out.
