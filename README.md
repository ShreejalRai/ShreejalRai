## Hi there 👋
I'm Shreejal, a Business Information Systems graduate based in Austraila. I like to unravel data and transform it into actionable insights.

If data pops into my life, chances are I’ll analyze it all. My primary tool is Power BI for data visualization, and I’m currently learning R to expand my analytical capabilities.

I have skills in statistical analysis, data cleaning, and creating compelling visualizations. My favorite projects involved a comprehensive analysis of renewable energy in Norway.

I have a growing portfolio that showcase my abilities and insights which you can check out here:
